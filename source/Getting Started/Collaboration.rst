Affiliated at "La Sapienza”, University of Rome, Physics department (Rome, Italy) and Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN), Section of Roma1 (Rome, Italy).
My PhD thesis was focused on the development of tools for quality control on therapeutic Carbon beams with FRED. Now, I am doing a postDoc within the Applied Radiation Physics Group (ARPG) in Rome. My research activity is still focused on the development and improvement of models for the interactions of ions with matter in the FRED code.
