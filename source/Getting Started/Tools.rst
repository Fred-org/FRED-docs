FRED Tools
==========

FRED tools is a collection of python functions for image manipulation and analysis. The basic methods have been developed for analysis of the images produced by the Monte Carlo FRED in MetaImage format (*.mha, *.mhd), but they can be applied for images in other formats, e.g. dicom.
