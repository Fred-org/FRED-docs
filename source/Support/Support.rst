FRED Support
=======================

The support and discussion forum is available on FRED-docs GitHub Discussion. Users are welcome to post questions, remarks, and requests.
The forum was set up to allow users to read the posts, but only users with a GitHub account can create a new post or participate in the discussion. We also recommend subscribing to the Discussion forum, as the `Announcement <https://github.com/Fred-org/FRED-docs/discussions/categories/announcement>`_ category will be used to share information about the new FRED releases, bug fixes, and features.


`Link to FRED discussion <https://github.com/Fred-org/FRED-docs/discussions>`_

You can still use the `General contact form <../_static/ContactForm_GeneralSupport.html>`_ to ask for support.
