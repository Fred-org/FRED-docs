Verification
=================================

Once FRED is installed, one can test the installation. Basic inline commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fred -h # print help
    $ fred -v # print version
    $ fred -performance # run the system performance scan both for CPU and GPU
    $ fred -benchmark N # run the standard benchmark for N primary particles (e.g. 1E5)
